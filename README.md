# FEUP - PLOG

Project/Works developed for the curricular unit of Programtion in Logic (PLOG) at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto (FEUP).
 In here, you will find two projects: Massacre Chess and Vacation Group Camp.<br /><br />
In the first, an implementation of the game created by Andy Lewicki. It is basically a variation of the conventional game of Chess, with a bunch of new rules, and where the objective of the game is either to eat all enemy pieces, or put him in such a position where he cannot eat your pieces anymore.<br /><br />

In the latter, the objective of this project is, given a summer camp, there are different activities. In each activity there will be the need to create groups with different sizes, and to maximize social interactions, all the person should have different persons in the group each activity.
